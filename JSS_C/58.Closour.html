<!-- 
Closure:
closure in action that is inner function can have acess to the outer function variable/parameter 
as well as global variable -->

<!-- ***** -->




<!-- Note :
In closure, we can't use the property of their child, but the child can use your property. Yes/No?"

The answer is YES.

Why?
A parent function cannot access the variables or properties declared inside its child functions because the child function's scope is local to itself. -->
