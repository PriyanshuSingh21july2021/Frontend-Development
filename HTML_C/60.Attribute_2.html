               HTML Attributes
               ChatGPT
               HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are included within the opening
               tags of those elements. Here's an overview of common HTML attributes:

               Event Attributes:

               Link Attributes:

               name and content: Used in the
               <meta> tag for various metadata (e.g., viewport settings, description).
               Script Attributes:

               pages.
